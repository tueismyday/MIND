I am creating a system of LLM's that can create a draft of different medical documents for nurses. The system utilizes guidelines for the document-type from the hospital, and a patient journal to fill out the document. In short: Guideline is collected, and an is created section by section by searing in the patient EHR using RRF RAG.
